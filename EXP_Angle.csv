No step-by-step explanation.
assistant

The image depicts a line segment with a right angle (90 degrees) and another line segment that forms a 45-degree angle with the horizontal line. The sum of these two angles is 90 + 45 = 135 degrees.

To find the exact angle, we can use the formula:

tan(θ) = opposite / adjacent

The image shows a line segment that forms an angle with the horizontal line. The length of the line segment is 4 units, and the length of the horizontal line is 5 units.

To find the exact angle in degrees, we can use the tangent function:

tan(θ) = opposite side / adjacent side

where θ is the angle, the opposite side is the length of the line segment (4 units), and the adjacent side is the length of the horizontal line (5 units).

The image shows a simple line drawing of two lines forming an angle. The angle is formed by the intersection of the two lines. To find the exact angle in degrees, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees.

Since the two lines form an angle, they also form a triangle with a third line that is not shown in the image. Let's call this third line the ""base"" of the triangle. The angle we are interested in is",[180.0],66,180.0,13924.0,13.526514521842069,12756.229400634766,0,67
